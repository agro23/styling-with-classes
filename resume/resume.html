      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p><span class="date">02/04 to present</span> – <span class="name">Studio Cutie, Project Manager.</span><br/>
      I letter comics and localize translations of both Japanese manga and French BD into colloquial English. I also manage and schedule sub-contractor teams that vary in size depending on each project to get digital lettering files turned into clients on a timely basis. I interface with clients and help them solve their lettering and translation needs for their comic projects with an aim toward bringing them out on time and in the highest quality.</</span>p>
      <p><span class="date">03/12 to 03/16</span> – <span class="name">Comic Rocket, Co-Founder.</span><br/> I helped start a digital comics business in 2012 as part of the Portland Seed Fund’s first class of city-backed companies. I did everything from client contact, management, and sales, to plotting corporate strategy, brand identity, and team management. I helped with the social networking online and in person and was the creator liaison balancing the needs of dozens of creators with those of the company. In 2016 we decided to spin the business down as everyone had other pressing interests to pursue.</p>
      <p><span class="date">03/07 to 12/11</span> – <span class="name">TRIPWIRE Magazine, US Editor.</span><br/> Tripwire was an annual magazine of genre culture including comics, TV, movies and more. We ran features, reviews, news, and interviews across a broad range of topics speaking with creators like Michael Moorcock and Guillermo Del Toro. My duties included writing, commissioning, and editing stories, proof-reading, light marketing, public interface, and general strategy planning. We worked from March to June every year putting out the best magazine we could manage to print. The magazine has since relaunched as a digital version.</p>
      <p><span class="date">08/02 to 1/03</span> - <span class="name">Electronic Arts, Core QA Tester.</span><br/> As the name implies I tested software and wrote bug reports. Although starting as a temp, I was picked to lead a team from EA to bolster testing at MAXIS on The Sims Online where I interfaced with producers and developers on a daily basis. In this position I became more familiar with the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2 than I ever thought possible.</p>
      <p><span class="date">01/03 to 2/04</span> – <span class="name">MAXIS, Core QA Tester / Localization Lead Tester.</span><br/> Duties included testing software, writing test plans, using productivity tools, and more. I was involved with the development of department processes and wrote the department's training manual. I worked on multiple titles under tight deadlines and served in management as both assistant and lead tester. I worked with production and development, creating and implementing tests, managing databases, handling team organization and leadership, generating reports, and creating processes for smoothing the workflow of an effective team. As Localization Lead I directed a group of twelve testers from various countries on a tight deadline through the process of translating, implementing, and testing game messages across multiple languages on three different game platforms. </p>

      <h2>Relevant Expertise</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been playing PC video games since they first started selling them, RPGs since the 70’s, and card games forever. I’ve sold games at retail, tested and localized games (2 years at EA/MAXIS), helped design games, reviewed them for people, and have generally been around games, both video and board or card, for a very long time. Lately I’ve even been designing board and card games for fun. I have experience with software, debugging, and generally understand the entire development process. Likewise, I’ve been deeply involved in the analog publishing business on all sides and from every angle.

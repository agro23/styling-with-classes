    <h2 class="flashy">How cupcake heaven came into being.</h2>
    <img src="img/buff-sto.jpg" alt="Our usual spread.">
	  <p>Cupcake heaven was once an idea that occurred to a simple baker out of Bakersfield. "What if," he thought, "there
    was a place where you didn't have to choose between great cupcake flavors because you could eat a little of every one?"</p>
    <p>He brought this idea forward to the Fraternal Order of Free Bakers one night and was laughed out of the lodge.</p>
    <p>Rather than swearing revenge and carrying out a lengthy program of targeted assassinations, he decided to prove them wrong by opening just such a restaurant. And so was born <strong>Cupcake Heaven!</strong></p>
